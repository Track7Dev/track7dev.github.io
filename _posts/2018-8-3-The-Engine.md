## The Man Behind the Patterns

Who will I be? What will I become? As I asked myself as a child, I thought I could never fathom to see myself as anything other than a Professional Skateboarder. I could feel it in every inch of my bones. I just KNEW this was my path, or so I thought. As i grew into an abundance of excitement for the life i was so prepared to follow, only to be brought into a profound realization by the simplest words from my father... 

What do you have to fall back on?

These words embedded into me as a child, at first being perceived as a lack of support, only to find it to be just as far from the truth. 

As years went by those words dug deeper into my brain. What do I have to fall back on? What if that doesn't work out, then what? Am I even destined to do this?. All these questions lingered throughout my brain into my early 20's. By this time I was a 'Jack of all trades', the go to guy. Anything you needed done or fixed  wether I knew how or not, I could get it done. I took pride in this, finally I had something to fall back on, quite a few things actually. I have built myself up to always be an asset to anyone for anything. I had become a Tattoo Artist, an inspiring musician and producer, a PHP web developer, a mechanic, a Graphic Designer, a computer technician, and anything else i needed to learn just to get the job done. I felt i had learned so much. I was indulging myself with so much information, I had felt accomplished, I have succeeded. 

Perspective in the form of the mind, is by far the greatest asset and downfall to life itself. 

I have accomplished so much to have only accomplished so little. The words of a wise manager I once had, forever changed my life. 

## "You are a man of many trades... But a master of NONE"

Speechless...    I had no words, after all she was right. I didn't tattoo in a shop I was decent as an amateur, but as a professional, I was far from that. My music was decent nothing fancy but was more personal to me. Being a PHP developer at that time was just basic get it done kind of work, confined to just that, with no real understanding or even the ability to comprehend the bigger picture of programming as a whole, I was lost. I knew how to work on cars, so there was that, but i really only knew how to work on my vehicles when they broke down. I had to research and figure it out or try to understand the patterns of functionality from the information that I could find, even though it wasn't for my vehicle. The only problem with that was, I didn't want to be a mechanic, I wasn't really sure exactly what I wanted to be.. 

###### Felt even more lost.



 25 years old was the goal I set.

## "Have A Career Before You Turn 25"

I was 23 working at cafe in downtown Fayetteville NC, and I will say that was probably the food places I honestly enjoyed working at. They took pride in their service and in the quality of their food, I know I used to make it, 
And they also had some of the best craft beer around. But needless to say all that came to a halt. I was now **FIRED**! No its not one of those stories about how the manager made my life a **Living Nightmare**. I was late, not only late but late after I was told the day before not to be late or i was fired. So at the end of the day it was completely my fault, and it wasn't because I didn't care, as that job paid my bills. I had trouble sleeping, that and i slept with the charger to my phone plugged in next to my knee. Which lead to me knocking it out the wall,to the phone dying so the alarm didn't go off, to of course lead me to wake up awkwardly late because you just know your getting fired, and all you have is an excuse that is only an excuse to you and no one else. Not to include the "If your late you're fired" comment the day before. 

## Now What!?

$400 in bills and i now have no job. As I sat around the house thinking of ways to make money, the first to come to mind **TATTOOS**. So I began making posts, expecting the money to just begin pouring my way, it sadly did not.Finally, I had a friend reach out, it was fairly simple tattoo even for my skill level at that time. The Day after she told me that her friend owns a shop and was in need of an artist. I wasn't very passionate about tattooing at the time but I needed a job so, She sent him pictures of my work. A minute goes by **Nothing**... 30 Mins **Nothing**... an hour **Nothing**... The days went by and still **Nothing**. There went any drive, any hope, and every thought of becoming a Professional Tattoo Artist. That was until the realization came to me that I didn't have an option to quit. The realization that I will be homeless, I will lose everything if I quit now. You never know it might just be a simple as **"Has he contacted you back yet"**. A message and a minute later I had my shot, I landed an interview as a Professional Tattoo Artist. I was **Excited**... at first, then came the nervousness, the Impostor Syndrome that seeps through our pours during our times of greatness. Can I do this? Do I even have the skills that it takes to do this?

## Why Not!

*I'm lost...*
Like literally lost my interview was scheduled at 7:30 and it is now 8...

Here comes that awkward late feeling again... expect this time, I don't even have the job yet. Should I just forget about it? Should I just go home?.. Well what's the worst that could happen, I don't get the job i never really wanted in the first place, or just go with it and see what happens.

I walked in, ask for the owner and unbeknownst to me he was behind me the entire time. He pulled me to the back, asked if i've ever tattooed Professionally. Of course I said no. I've always felt it was best to be upfront. I didn't want to be caught in a situation I'm not capable of handling (Like Portraits for instance). So we walked back to the front, and thats when everything began to get real for me.

## "Who wants a free tattoo, whatever you want"

The tattoo... A Military Pinup.
Mentally I started freaking out. This is the tattoo that will determine if i will begin a **New Career** as a Professional Tattoo Artist. So I began to think to myself, I can freak out and mess up this tattoo, or do the best that I can with **Confidence**. I'd rather lose the opportunity for a job because I wasn't qualified at all not because I didn't seem qualified at that time.

###### Impostor Syndrome

So I did the next best thing, I had fun with it. Towards the end of the tattoo, the owner walks in, leans over the tattoo... silence struck the room.

## "See You Tomorrow"

Finally.. I have done it. I have successfully found myself a **Career** at the age of 23, two before the goal i previously set. Even-though the road has only began, i couldn't help but to feel true accomplishment.
