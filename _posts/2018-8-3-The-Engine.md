## The Man Behind the Patterns

Who will I be? What will I become? As I asked myself as a child, I thought I could never fathom to see myself as anything other than a Professional Skateboarder. I could feel it in every inch of my bones. I just KNEW this was my path, or so I thought. As i grew into an abundance of excitement for the life i was so prepared to follow, only to be brought into a profound realization by the simplest words from my father... 

What do you have to fall back on?

These words embedded into me as a child, at first being perceived as a lack of support, only to find it to be just as far from the truth. 

As years went by those words dug deeper into my brain. What do I have to fall back on? What if that doesn't work out, then what? Am I even destined to do this?. All these questions lingered throughout my brain into my early 20's. By this time I was a 'Jack of all trades', the go to guy. Anything you needed done or fixed  whether I knew how or not, I could get it done. I took pride in this, finally I had something to fall back on, quite a few things actually. I have built myself up to always be an asset to anyone for anything. I had become a Tattoo Artist, an inspiring musician and producer, a PHP web developer, a mechanic, a Graphic Designer, a computer technician, and anything else i needed to learn just to get the job done. I felt i had learned so much. I was indulging myself with so much information, I had felt accomplished, I have succeeded. 

Perspective in the form of the mind, is by far the greatest asset and downfall to life itself. 

I have accomplished so much to have only accomplished so little. The words of a wise manager I once had, forever changed my life. 

## "You are a man of many trades... But a master of NONE"

Speechless...    I had no words, after all she was right. I didn't tattoo in a shop I was decent as an amateur, but as a professional, I was far from that. My music was decent nothing fancy but was more personal to me. Being a PHP developer at that time was just basic get it done kind of work, confined to just that, with no real understanding or even the ability to comprehend the bigger picture of programming as a whole, I was lost. I knew how to work on cars, so there was that, but i really only knew how to work on my vehicles when they broke down. I had to research and figure it out or try to understand the patterns of functionality from the information that I could find, even though it wasn't for my vehicle. The only problem with that was, I didn't want to be a mechanic, I wasn't really sure exactly what I wanted to be.. 

###### Felt even more lost.



 25 years old was the goal I set.

## "Have A Career Before You Turn 25"

I was 23 working at a cafe in downtown Fayetteville NC, and I will say that was probably one of the best food places I've ever worked at. They took pride in their service and in the quality of their food, I know I used to make it, And they also had some of the best craft beer around. But needless to say all that came to a halt. I was now **FIRED**! No its not one of those stories about how the manager made my life a **Living Nightmare**. I was late, not only late but late after I was told the day before not to be late or i was fired. So at the end of the day it was completely my fault, and it wasn't because I didn't care, as that job paid my bills. I had trouble sleeping, that and i slept with the charger to my phone plugged in next to my knee. Which lead to me knocking it out the wall,to the phone dying so the alarm didn't go off, to of course lead me to wake up awkwardly late because you just know your getting fired, and all you have is an excuse that is only an excuse to you and no one else. Not to include the "If your late you're fired" comment the day before. 

## Now What!?

$400 in bills and i now have no job. As I sat around the house thinking of ways to make money, the first to come to mind **TATTOOS**. So I began making posts, expecting the money to just begin pouring my way, it sadly did not.Finally, I had a friend reach out, it was fairly simple tattoo even for my skill level at that time. The Day after she told me that her friend owns a shop and was in need of an artist. I wasn't very passionate about tattooing at the time but I needed a job so, She sent him pictures of my work. A minute goes by **Nothing**... 30 Mins **Nothing**... an hour **Nothing**... The days went by and still **Nothing**. There went any drive, any hope, and every thought of becoming a Professional Tattoo Artist. That was until the realization came to me that I didn't have an option to quit. The realization that I will be homeless, I will lose everything if I quit now. You never know it might just be a simple as **"Has he contacted you back yet"**. A message and a minute later I had my shot, I landed an interview as a Professional Tattoo Artist. I was **Excited**... at first, then came the nervousness, the Impostor Syndrome that seeps through our pours during our times of greatness. Can I do this? Do I even have the skills that it takes to do this?

## Why Not!

*I'm lost...*
Like literally lost my interview was scheduled at 7:30 and it is now 8...

Here comes that awkward late feeling again... expect this time, I don't even have the job yet. Should I just forget about it? Should I just go home?.. Well what's the worst that could happen, I don't get the job i never really wanted in the first place, or just go with it and see what happens.

I walked in, ask for the owner and unbeknownst to me he was behind me the entire time. He pulled me to the back, asked if i've ever tattooed Professionally. Of course I said no. I've always felt it was best to be upfront. I didn't want to be caught in a situation I'm not capable of handling (Like Portraits for instance). So we walked back to the front, and thats when everything began to get real for me.

## "Who wants a free tattoo, whatever you want"

The tattoo... A Military Pinup.
Mentally I started freaking out. This is the tattoo that will determine if i will begin a **New Career** as a Professional Tattoo Artist. So I began to think to myself, I can freak out and mess up this tattoo, or do the best that I can with **Confidence**. I'd rather lose the opportunity for a job because I wasn't qualified at all not because I didn't seem qualified at that time.

###### *Impostor Syndrome*

So I did the next best thing, I had fun with it. Towards the end of the tattoo, the owner walks in, leans over the tattoo... silence struck the room.

## "See You Tomorrow"

Finally.. I have done it. I have successfully found myself a **Career** at the age of 23, two years before the goal i previously set. Even-though the road has only began, i couldn't help but to feel true accomplishment. 

A few days into my new career, enthusiasm sky high, nothing could go wrong. That was until a tattoo came in that was a little beyond my comfort zone. Just like that I was back in this same feeling of despair, but this time I have no choice. This is what I signed up for, This is what i was hired for, I have an obligation to work to the fullest of my ability so only thing to do now is work. To my surprise the tattoo that i believe to be far beyond my skill-set actually turned out pretty good, it wasn't perfect but it set the act in motion. Maybe i am better than I think, and maybe I could be better. So i grinded, learned everything thing I could about tattooing professionally, some by technique others by experience.

A couple years pass, by now I have established myself in the tattoo industry, quality of work were up to par, i have learned my craft, And i was ready for another. I wanted to work with programming again, the shop was need of a website, what better why to get practice in. At the time i was working with PHP and Javascript with MySQL to build websites, im not going to lie, back then, JavaScript was not my friend. Actually I think Javascript had many friends around that time. Now I'm in love with it as a language, but we'll get to that. So at this time i was getting the hang of things, FINALLY i had understood some form of programming syntax, and just like speaking language they all go hand-in-hand. But just like everything else without the right guidance or path, you will never be able to comprehend how to master your craft. Some time goes by and I still haven't progress into any greater than where I was at. Then one day i get news the shop will be moving and I was going to be outta work for some time. So, I decided to take advantage of the time to really get into programming. I've always liked working with the C# language from my time programming games on Unity Game Engine. The Framework I chose, .Net ... ok so at first it was a daunting task to grasp, but next thing you know im build windows apps. I was getting pretty decent with understanding the language as cramming information into my head seemed to work well as a learning method. 

So one day I just happened to be looking through social media and I came across an Ad for a school that said '$0 up front pay nothing unless you get a $50k+ job'... Ummmm Whats the catch... so I clicked it, I usually don't, but something told me to, like I was destined for it, and at the point...

## My Life Would Change Forever

# LambdaSchool

I didn't know what to expect, but something was driving me to press that submit button on the application and hope for the best.. So I did, few days later I get the email ive been waiting for, i pulled down the notification bar just to peek and the few words i did see were 

## You are Tentatively Accepted!

My heart dropped, with 5% acceptance rate I was accepted, But that was only the beginning as I fully open the email, what I have received was a CATCH, the only one i've ever experience with LambdaSchool throughout the entire program. What's the Catch? You must first be able to complete their pre-course work. I began to worry, am i even capable of this? After getting node and git setup to pull the repos for the pre-course work, I was on my way. First section I flew through as i had previous experience working with the material being presented. Second Section, Third Section Complete, Fourth Section, I've hit a snag. I Had no idea how to solve these problems! Now what? Determined to finish what i've started, I began researching how to solve issues I was having. I didn't want to cheat myself so I researched the patterns to the problem and why it was solved the way it was. One problem after a next, the green checks lighting up Mocha inside the terminal. I'm doing it, I'm learning how to learn. As the last check crossed my screen, the anticipation grew big, even-though I still had a week too finished, i needed it done right then and there, I enjoyed solving the problems, running into more problems only to come out stronger fascinated me. This is my passion,

### This is where I Belong.

It was different than anything i've ever been apart of. I felt as if I was one with the community I was with even-tough they were across the united states. As quickly as the week went by so did the material, It was like you handed somebody a manual to build a car, a week later you hand them a manual to build a plane, at this point they haven't even came close to understand how to build a car and now you want to throw a plane on top of it, now a week later they get a manual on how to build a spaceship. They've had it, They're done, there is no way for them to understand and remember all of that. But That would be looking at it the wrong way. The question isn't how difficult the spaceship is, but understand how easy the car was.
There were times I questioned if this was really for me, felt as if I wasn't smart enough for this career. I wasn't having it, i was not going to cross paths and make through so many obstacles to fail by one. That was the moment. I had my **AH HA!!** moment and everything just **CLICKED** things that were so hard to grasp are now child's play. I was coding 10 - 15 hours a day, some days just blended from lack of slept from grinding it to as far as you can. Even now i haven't slept from coding all night. I'm in loce, I have reach part 1 to my goal i have learned my craft, and now I have the ability  

##  To Teach myself to master my craft!

I went through the up rises and the down falls to get where I am today.

Programming is like Life, Sometime you have to break it, to understand, in order to make it completely whole.

Finishing that program was one of my most personal accomplishments, I feel as if the knowledge i've obtained was stolen by my own hands. Day 342 with $0 invested, that can change the world, for man and for tech.
